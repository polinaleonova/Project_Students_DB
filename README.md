 Good day, this web project was creation for control of the Student's database.
And it was building without any JS, only by means of Django-framework,
HTML and CSS (stylization was made with twitter bootstrap).

 The access to the data like the data of Student's database must be limited. Only 
authorized and authenticated persons can use the database's information.
If you are registered, first of all you must to log in.
At present we located on the page with all groups, which was included in our database.
Here we see Name of the group, number of students and name of the monitor for each group.
If you want to look on the all students of any group, you can click on the group name like this.
Here located all student's names and their photos. 
But it is not all information, it is only first page. To know more we must to leaf through onward.

 The next power of this project - it is changing of the database. Click on the button
"Make changes to the database", and we will move on the page, where we can to 
create new group , to delete group  or to edit.
We can change the name group and name of the group's monitor, and also
make change to the students of this group. It very simple to create new student, to 
delete  and to edit any student's information like ticket number, name,
date of birthday or photo. 
You can also make changes to our database by the admin page. For this you must click
on "Edit in Admin Panel".
 And this string include the information about number of call to database and the time
of execution the http-request.

Django signals, commands, template context processor, custom template tag, writing own
middleware class and others.
